# Project BarbiE

SGX Enabled OpenStack Barbican Key Management System

##### This software is a research proof of concept and not intended for production use ######

## Create BarbiE Installer

Go to intel-sgx/source/SGX-Barbican/

Run
 
```
   sudo ./makeself_installer.sh
```

It will create **BarbiE.bz2.run** binary

## BarbiE Installation

Execute "BarbiE.bz2.run" as root user on the machine where you want to setup Barbican with IP address as argument

```
    sudo ./BarbiE.bz2.run <ip_v4_address>
```

During installation it will prompt for details for self signed SSL certificate generation.

### Pre-requisite

* All properties are mandatory 

  *Required Properties are **BARBICAN_ENCLAVE_PATH**, **IAS_URL**, **IAS_CRT_PATH**, **IAS_SPID**, **IAS_ENABLED** for Barbican on different lines*

```
  Example:
         BARBICAN_ENCLAVE_PATH=/opt/BarbiE/lib
         IAS_URL=https://test-as.sgx.trustedservices.intel.com:443/attestation/sgx/v1/report
         IAS_CRT_PATH=/root/client.pem
         IAS_SPID=76508EJNCLBLB8DS19AC35I5U7XDV828
         IAS_ENABLED=True/False
```

**IAS_ENABLED** : Enables/disabled communication of server with IAS for quote verification.

**IAS_URL, IAS_CRT_PATH, IAS_SPID ** : Required for quote verification with IAS.

### Barbican service start/stop/restart

```
/opt/BarbiE/startup.sh start/stop/restart
```

## Testing Barbican SGX Integration

Go under /opt/BarbiE/test_scripts/

```
sudo python sgx.py <SPID> <CRT_PATH>
```

SPID     : SPID provided by IAS in hexstring format
CRT_PATH : Absolute path of certificate for IAS server

## Sample Commands

###  Provision Master key encryption key on Barbican

```
sudo python sgx_client_wo_hw.py -ip [<IP>] -p <proj_id> [--admin] -s [<SPID>] -crt [<IAS_CRT>] [--server_verify_ias] [--client_verify_ias]
```

    IP      : IPv4 address of the server. Default :- localhost
    proj_id : Project ID
    client_verify_ias : Client will call IAS for quote verification.
    server_verify_ias : Server will call IAS for quote verification.
    SPID    : SPID provided by IAS in hexstring format. Required only when we are providing 'client_verify_ias'
    IAS_CRT : Absolute path of certificate for IAS server. Required only when we are providing 'client_verify_ias'

### SGX Aware client(without SGX Hardware) talking with Barbican Enclave E

```diff
- The above test scripts are for standalone use of barbican. If barbican is configured with Keystone, the client scripts wont work.
